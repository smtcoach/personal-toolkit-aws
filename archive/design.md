# Archived Frontend Design Brief

This document records an earlier UI redesign brief for the Personal Toolkit dashboard. The active implementation now lives in `frontend-react/`, and the current project documentation lives in the repository root.

## Design Direction

The goal was to turn the original page into a clean, modern, restrained personal dashboard with a style close to lightweight SaaS tools such as Notion, Linear, and Apple system interfaces.

Primary visual goals:

- White or near-white page background.
- Subtle gray borders.
- Light shadows.
- Small border radii.
- Generous whitespace.
- Black and gray typography.
- Minimal dashboard composition.
- Consistent card styling.

Avoided visual patterns:

- Loud gradients.
- Large saturated color blocks.
- Glassmorphism.
- Excessively rounded cards.
- Decorative icon overload.
- Heavy shadows.

## Layout

The page was intended to use a centered container with a maximum width around 1200 to 1280 pixels. The dashboard should feel calm, spacious, and easy to scan.

The earlier concept used card-based sections for:

- Weather.
- News.
- Tasks.
- Nearby restaurant recommendations.

The current active product changed the feature mix and now includes weather, news, movies, and tasks.

## Card Style

Cards should use:

- White background.
- Light gray borders.
- Subtle shadows.
- Compact but readable headings.
- Clear spacing between content blocks.
- Restrained hover states.

## Interaction Notes

Controls should feel like a practical dashboard rather than a marketing page. The UI should prioritize repeat use, readability, and fast scanning.
